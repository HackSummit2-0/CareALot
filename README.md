## About The Project

<u>Basically the main goal of disaster management is to reduce the damages and to safeguard common people including physically challenged people during the natural calamities. So here we are trying to create a Portal with the following objectives :-</b></u>

                       <li> Reducing vulnerability and potential losses of hazard by alerting the necessary info of the upcoming disaster. </li>
                       <li>Assessing, reviewing and controlling the risk. Applying efficient, effective, sustainable relief (food, shelter and money), medical and other facilities in disaster affected people thus they can survive. </li> 
                        <li>Reducing the damage, death, sufferings and destruction of any natural and human induced disaster. </li>
                        <li> Ensuring the availability of local emergency equipment and transportation through NGO's and government helpline numbers.</li>
                       <li>NGOs organizations can join these website so that the donated money can be given to the people who are in need.</li>
